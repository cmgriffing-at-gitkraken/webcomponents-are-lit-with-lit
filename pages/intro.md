## Developer Advocate at GitKraken

- GitKraken Desktop
- GitLens
    - VSCode
    - more soon...
- GitKraken CLI
- GitKraken.dev
    - Mobile Responsive

<!-- 

We want to meet developers where they are already.

This is also my first role as a Developer Advocate, so I'm sorry if that felt like marketing.

I feel like the GitKraken thing is directly relevant to later parts of this talk, though.
